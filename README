        o LaunchMON 0.6.4 service release
        o Validated the combinations of various configure options and
	  Changed the configuration policy as follows.
          + Made --with-bootfabric --with-rm --with-gcrypt mandatory options
	     - The default for the bootfabric option is --with-bootfabric=pmgr.
               --with-bootfabric=mpi has been deprecated due to a naming collision 
	       with the GCRYPT package.
	     - Merged with-slurm and with-bglrm into --with-rm[=slurm,bglrm]
 	       for conciseness. The default for with-rm is slurm. 
	o Taken together, to configure, to build and to install the package
	  On X86/X86_64/Linux/SLURM
                 ./configure --with-bootfabric=pmgr --with-rm=slurm --prefix=/myhome

                 make install
