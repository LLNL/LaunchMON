              does not necessary mean that the certifciate is not
              available but the specification method may not be usable
              for the given certificate.  May also happen for
              certificates somewhere in the chain while validaiting a
              certificate chain.
            - The requested encryption certificate was not found.

        Libgcrypt.

        returned if a crypto context initialized for a different
        algorithm is used.

        The public key was mathematically not correctly generated.
        (It would have been nicer if we would have used BAD_PUBKEY for
        this, but that error code is in long time use to describe for
        example policy and encoding problems with a key.  Using
        INV_PUBKEY would have been better for these purposes)
