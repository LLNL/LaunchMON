	* Customize the package for tools use.
		
	* command line support: this support allows clients to pick up 
	  the newtork configuration information such as job size, job id and 
	  the mpirun's hostname. The mods are contained under the 
	  COMMLINE_SUPPORT macro. 

	* lazy rank binding support: when there is no rank information 
	  readily available in clients' environment, this support allows 
	  mpirun to assign an unque id (first come first served, 0 based 
	  and monotonically increasing) to each client. The modifications
	  are contained under LAZY_RANK_BINDING 
		
	* fine grain mpirun interface support: under FINEGRAIN_MPIRUN_INTERFACE.
	  This support is designed to help the caller of the mpirun API easily
	  get program control transferred from the main mpirun API routine. 

	* more collective operations testing: under TEST_MORE_COLLS.

	* src/pmgr_collective_mpirun.c : Replaced tab indents with spaces (code cleanup).

2008-01-22 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/pmgr_collective_client.c : Integrated patch from Chris Morrone
	  to poll on connection and retry with backoff on configurable
	  timeout.  The default TCP timeout was causing problems at 8192+
	  task counts.

	* PMGR_COLLECTIVE.README : Added note about pmgr_connect variables.

	* src/pmgr_collective_client.h,
	  src/pmgr_collective_client.c : Dropped hostname string list
	  from pmgr_init and corresponding MPIRUN_PROCESSES and
	  NOT_USE_TOTALVIEW variables.  Added pmgr_allgatherstr to assist
	  user in gathering this info through PMGR_COLLECTIVE calls.
	  Added pmgr_allreducemaxint as a utility for pmgr_allgatherstr.

	* test/client.c : Removed hostlist parameter from call to pmgr_init.

	* test/mpirun_rsh.c : Removed code which sets MPIRUN_PROCESSES and
	  NOT_USE_TOTALVIEW.

	* PMGR_COLLECTIVE.README : Removed documentation about MPIRUN_PROCESSES
	  and NOT_USE_TOTALVIEW.

	* src/pmgr_collective_common.h,
	  src/pmgr_collective_common.c,

	  src/pmgr_collective_mpirun.c : Moved pmgr_gettimeofday and pmgr_getsecs
	  to common.

	* src/pmgr_collective_common.c : Added debug statements to time pmgr_* calls.

2008-01-02 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* makefile : Moved *.h files to src directory.  Have make copy them
	  to include directory on build.

	* src/pmgr_collective_client.c,
	  src/pmgr_collective_mpirun.c : Added filename and line number info
	  to pmgr_error messages.

	* src/pmgr_collective_mpirun.c : Added timers to debug statements.

	* src/pmgr_collective_common.h,
	  src/pmgr_collective_common.c : Added debug levels to pmgr_debug().

	* test/mpirun_rsh.c : Added to test pmgr_processops functionality.

	* test/client.c : Added pmgr_barrier() test.

	* PMGR_COLLECTIVE.README : Added readme to describe pros and cons
	  of current implemenation and to document build-time and run-time
	  options.
