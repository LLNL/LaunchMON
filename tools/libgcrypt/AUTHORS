============

Libgcrypt used to be part of GnuPG but has been taken out into its own
package on 2000-12-21.

The ATH implementation (src/ath*) has been taken from GPGME and
relicensed to the LGPL by the copyright holder of GPGME (g10 Code
GmbH); it is now considered to be a part of Libgcrypt.

Most of the stuff in mpi has been taken from an old GMP library
version by Torbjorn Granlund <tege@noisy.tmg.se>.

The files cipher/rndunix.c and cipher/rndw32.c are based on those
files from Cryptlib.  Copyright Peter Gutmann, Paul Kendall, and Chris
Wedgwood 1996-1999.

The ECC code cipher/ecc.c was based on code by Sergi Blanch i Torne,
sergi at calcurco dot org.

The implementation of the Camellia cipher has been been taken from the
original NTT provided GPL source.

The CAVS testing program tests/cavs_driver.pl is not to be considered
a part of libgcrypt proper.  We distribute it merely for convenience.
It has a permissive license and is copyrighted by atsec information
security corporation.  See the file for details.

The file salsa20.c is based on D.J. Bernstein's public domain code and
taken from Nettle.  Copyright 2012 Simon Josefsson and Niels Möller.
